Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations, like 10 simulations or 100 simulations, the ranking is quite random.
with 1000 simulations it starts stabilizing, but it's still incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000 simulations. Also with 10000 simulations the order is correct,
but I think the precision is not there yet.
